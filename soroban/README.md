# Soroban Project

> [!WARNING]

This repository contains [Soroban] contracts used in the `sep-smart-wallet` application, demonstrating account abstraction on [Stellar] with support for [WebAuthn].

## Contracts

- `webauthn-factory`: A Soroban factory contract that deploys and initializes new instances of WebAuthn contract accounts.
- `webauthn-wallet`: A Soroban account contract initialized with an ECDSA secp256r1 public key for a WebAuthn device (e.g., a passkey from a browser, computer, phone, or Yubikey). This contract functions as an account on the network, capable of holding assets and controlled by the WebAuthn device's signatures.

## Usage

To deploy the contracts for this demo, use the [`Makefile`] in this repository with the following commands:

```sh
make build
make deploy
```

ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ At this stage, youâ€™ll need to update the Makefile with the following values:

- `WEBAUTHN_FACTORY`: The address of the deployed `webauthn-factory` contract.
- `WEBAUTHN_WASM`: The WASM hash for the `webauthn-wallet` contract.

Once updated, you can initialize the factory contract by running:

```sh
make init
```
